# HyFlexPIM
HyFlexPIM noise-aware simulator

This is the noise-aware simulator for HyFlexPIM.
It is designed to evaluate the accuracy results shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 of our paper. (Link will be added)

The simulator follows a 5-step flow:

1. Model Preparation
2. Original model training
3. SVD Preprocessing
4. Fine-tuning & Gradient Redistribution
5. Noise-injected Inference

# HyFlexPIM  
**HyFlexPIM Noise-Aware Simulator**

This is the **noise-aware simulator** for **HyFlexPIM**, developed to evaluate the accuracy results shown in **Figure 12** and **Figure 13** of our ISCA 2025 submission.

The simulation flow consists of the following five steps:
- Model Preparation
- Original model training 
- SVD Preprocessing   
- Fine-tuning & Gradient Redistribution  
- Noise-injected Inference
